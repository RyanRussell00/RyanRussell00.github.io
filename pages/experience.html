                <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/experience" target="_blank">The Merriam-Webster
                    Dictionary</a> defines "experience" as "the fact or state of having been affected by or
                gained knowledge through direct observation or participation". But I believe that experience goes much
                further than that.
                Experience means having put in time, effort, and sweat to achieve a goal or milestone that makes you
                proud. Whether it's a project for a business or even learning how to tie shoelaces- Experience is the
                foundation for building your future.
